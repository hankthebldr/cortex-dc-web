# DataConnect Configuration Changes

## Changes Made to firebase.json

### Original Configuration (Preserved)
All original firebase.json configuration was preserved. No existing configurations were deleted per project rules.

### Additions Made by Firebase CLI
The Firebase CLI (`firebase init dataconnect`) automatically added the following configuration blocks:

#### 1. DataConnect Service Configuration
```json
{
  "dataconnect": {
    "source": "dataconnect"
  }
}
```

#### 2. DataConnect Emulator Configuration  
```json
{
  "emulators": {
    "dataconnect": {
      "port": 9399,
      "dataDir": "dataconnect/.dataconnect/pgliteData"
    }
  }
}
```

### Why These Changes Were Needed
1. **DataConnect Service**: Required to define the DataConnect service deployment source directory
2. **Emulator Configuration**: Enables local development with DataConnect emulator using pglite for offline GraphQL testing

### Integration with Existing Services
The DataConnect configuration integrates seamlessly with existing Firebase services:
- **Hosting**: Native GraphQL endpoint integration (no manual rewrites needed)
- **Functions**: Can consume GraphQL API directly
- **Firestore/Storage**: Complementary data storage alongside structured GraphQL data
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Firebase Auth for @auth directives

### Rollback Process
If rollback is needed:
1. Remove `"dataconnect": { "source": "dataconnect" }` from firebase.json
2. Remove dataconnect emulator configuration from emulators section
3. Delete `dataconnect/` directory if desired (not recommended - keep for historical reference)
4. Run `firebase deploy` to update configuration

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing hosting rewrites preserved
- All existing security headers maintained  
- All existing Firebase service configurations unchanged
- Monorepo structure and build scripts enhanced, not replaced

## package.json Script Additions

### New Scripts Added
```json
{
  "firebase:dataconnect": "firebase deploy --only dataconnect",
  "firebase:deploy:dataconnect": "firebase deploy --only dataconnect", 
  "firebase:deploy:all": "pnpm build && firebase deploy"
}
```

### Integration with Existing Scripts
- Preserves all existing firebase:* scripts
- Follows established naming conventions
- Maintains pnpm + turbo build pipeline
- Compatible with existing deployment workflows

## Summary

All configuration changes were additive only. No existing functionality was modified or removed, ensuring zero breaking changes to the established cortex-dc-web platform while adding powerful GraphQL + Cloud SQL capabilities through Firebase Data Connect.
